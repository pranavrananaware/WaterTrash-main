Water Trash Detection and Classification System
A smart AI-powered solution to detect and classify waterborne trash using deep learning, empowering communities and authorities to take timely environmental action.

🧠 Overview
This project focuses on real-time detection and classification of trash in water bodies using deep learning techniques (YOLOv8), integrated into a cross-platform application (web/mobile) using Flutter. The system helps identify types of waste such as plastic, metal, organic waste, and more, assisting in maintaining cleaner water bodies.

🚀 Features
📸 Real-time trash detection via camera or uploaded images

🧾 Classification of trash (e.g., plastic, bottle, paper, etc.)

🗺️ Geo-tagging of detection location using GPS

☁️ Firebase integration for image & data storage

🔔 Notification alerts for admin when new trash is detected

📊 Admin dashboard (planned) for monitoring reports

📱 Cross-platform support (Android, Web)

🧪 Dataset
Collected & labeled trash images from water bodies

Augmented for plastic bottles, cans, bags, organic waste

Trained using Roboflow + YOLOv8 pipeline
