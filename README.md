## 📖 **OVERVIEW**

The **Water Trash Detection and Classification System** is designed to identify and classify types of waste floating in water (e.g., plastic bottles, cans, paper) using YOLOv8 deep learning models. The system integrates with a cross-platform Flutter app and Firebase backend to support real-time trash detection, reporting, and tracking with GPS metadata.
