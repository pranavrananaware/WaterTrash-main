#  Water Trash Detection System

The Water Trash Detection System is an AI-powered mobile and web application designed to detect and classify trash in water bodies using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) deep learning technology. This system enables users to capture photos or videos of polluted areas, automatically identify trash objects, and report them to authorities or environmental organizations. It aims to enhance environmental sustainability by enabling real-time trash detection, geotagging, and automated reporting for better waste management.

Key Features
 1.AI-Based Trash Detection – Uses YOLOv8 to detect and classify trash (plastic, metal, glass, organic waste, etc.).
2. Mobile & Web App – Built using Flutter for cross-platform accessibility.
3. Live Camera Capture & Image Upload – Allows users to capture images of polluted water bodies for analysis.
4. Automatic Geotagging – Captures the location of detected trash and maps it for easy tracking.
5. Real-Time Notifications – Sends alerts to environmental agencies when a new trash report is submitted.
6 Offline Mode – Enables users to capture and store images offline, syncing them when an internet connection is available.
7. Admin Dashboard – Provides analytics on trash reports, location-based trends, and cleanup progress.
8. Recycling Recommendations – Suggests the best disposal methods and nearest recycling centers.
